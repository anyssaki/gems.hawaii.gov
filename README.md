Due to the varying web development experiences of the GEMS website contributors, little to no programming experience should be required leading me to purchase Divi.  This theme builder allows me, the designer and developer, to customize as necessary while improving ADA Compliance and ease-of-use for the potential, numerous contributors.  Divi has provided [documentation](https://www.elegantthemes.com/documentation/developers/divi-development-environment/) to setting up a Docker environment compatible with Divi and WordPress.
